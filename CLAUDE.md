## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

<!-- BEGIN WYK CONVENTIONS v:1 -->
## wyk — planning & handoff over bd

This repo uses **wyk**, a view + handoff layer over **bd (beads)**. "Plan
it in wyk" = **file the plan as bd issues** (deps via `bd dep add`), not
markdown/TodoWrite. File with **`wyk create`** (same flags as `bd create`,
forwarded verbatim) — it also stamps the Claude session so the TUI's
Session column traces work back to a conversation. A PreToolUse hook
blocks raw `bd create` and tells you to switch; that's expected — just
re-run as `wyk create`.

**Owner column** — whose move it is, label-driven (NOT bd's owner/assignee):
- `human` → **HUMAN** (a human must act).
- `agent-handoff` → **AGENT-HANDOFF**: another agent owns it; don't touch,
  a human coordinates. Excluded from `wyk inbox`.
- agent task blocked by a `human`-flagged dep → **HUMAN-BLOCK** (skip it).
- else → **AGENT** (the default; a null owner is never blank — so a task
  that needs a human MUST be handed off, or the human never sees it).

**Hand off to a human**: `wyk handoff <id>` (or `wyk handoff -create "<title>"`)
sets `human` + writes the runbook. Never hand-roll labels; `-a`/`--claim`
are bd's status, not the badge.

**Pick up work**: `wyk inbox` FIRST (items bounced back to you — WORK them),
then `wyk` / `bd ready`. `wyk conventions` prints the full contract.

**Something wrong? Act — don't shrug.** If a wyk/bd command errors, a
convention looks broken, or the workflow rubs wrong, file a bd issue (with
an owner) and fix or hand it off — don't route around it silently.
Friction with wyk is product data; surfacing it is the job.
